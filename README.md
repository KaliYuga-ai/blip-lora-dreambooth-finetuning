# KaliYuga's simple fork of brian6091's LoRA-Enabled Dreambooth notebook.

In addition to some minor changes and rewording for clarity, this fork adds a slightly modified version of BLIP dataset autocaptioning functionality from victorchall's EveryDream comapnion tools repo to brian6091's notebook.

Once you've autocaptioned your datasets, you can use this same notebook to train Stable Diffusion models on those datasets using Dreambooth and/or Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches.
